# Filter Wheel Registry Configuration (v1.0)
#
# This file defines all filter wheels in the system with their positions
# and installed filters. Acquisition channels specify filter_position;
# the wheel is resolved via hardware_bindings.yaml based on camera ID.
#
# This file is optional. If not present, filter wheel settings in channels
# are ignored.
#
# Copy this file to filter_wheels.yaml and edit for your system.

version: 1.0

filter_wheels:
  # Emission filter wheel (after sample, before camera)
  - name: "Emission Filter Wheel"
    id: 1                          # Hardware ID for controller
    type: emission                 # Required: emission or excitation
    positions:
      1: "Empty"
      2: "BP 525/50"               # GFP emission
      3: "BP 600/50"               # mCherry emission
      4: "BP 700/75"               # Far red emission
      5: "LP 650"                  # Long pass

  # Example: Excitation filter wheel (for LED/lamp systems)
  # - name: "Excitation Filter Wheel"
  #   id: 2
  #   type: excitation
  #   positions:
  #     1: "Empty"
  #     2: "BP 470/40"             # GFP excitation
  #     3: "BP 560/40"             # mCherry excitation

  # Example: Multi-camera system with separate filter wheels
  # - name: "Camera 1 Filter Wheel"
  #   id: 1
  #   type: emission
  #   positions:
  #     1: "Empty"
  #     2: "BP 525/50"
  #
  # - name: "Camera 2 Filter Wheel"
  #   id: 2
  #   type: emission
  #   positions:
  #     1: "Empty"
  #     2: "BP 600/50"
